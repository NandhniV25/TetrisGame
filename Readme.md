### Game Rules
* We have some different shapes which are falling from top to bottom
* As long as, the object is not interfered by any other object it will fall in.
* If it touches other object, it will become static object.
* Once we complete one full row with blocks, that row will be deleted and we get points.
* All the blocks which are above the deleted row will come down one step.
